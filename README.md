# LED Matrix Animation Project

This project demonstrates how to create animations on an 8x8 LED matrix using the `LedControl` library. The animation cycles through different frames to create a dynamic visual effect.

## Features
- Displays an animated sequence on an 8x8 LED matrix.
- Uses the `LedControl` library for controlling the LED matrix.
- Simple and efficient code for dynamic animations.

## Animation Frames

The animation consists of three states (frames) that cycle continuously. Below are the frames:

### State 1
